 # Analysing loadshedding in South Africa from Google yrends of 2004 - 2022

In this project I am showcasing my Data Analytics skills by exploring South Africa's loadshedding interest by analysing Google trends data. I am still working on improving the visualisations and intepretations from this data to help anyone easily understand and also see answers to interesting questions.
